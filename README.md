# :building_construction: WIP : Poetree Backend
This is the poetree's app backend built with ktor.

## Endpoints
The details of the enpoints can be found ![here](https://mambo-bryan.gitbook.io/poetree-api/)
For those who'd like test the endpoints on Postman or Insomnia I've added the compiled apis file in the download folder ![here]("/downloads")

## The Rest
Guess it's a work in progress...
